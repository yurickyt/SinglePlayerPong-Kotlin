# SinglePlayerPong-Kotlin
The app works in vertical orientation only. This app is the game of pong.

When the app starts, the user is ready to play the game of pong. There is a small ball somewhere (you choose) at the top of the screen and a "paddle" somewhere (you choose) at the bottom of the screen. The paddle should be a drawn rectangle and the ball should be a drawn circle. When the user touches the screen, the game starts. The ball comes down at a 45 degrees angle (either left or right) and will bounce off the walls and bounce off the paddle at that same 45 degrees angle. The user can move the paddle from left to right and right to left (always horizontally)
by moving his/her finger. If the ball goes through without hitting the paddle, then the game is over. There'll be something drawn on the screen reporting the number of times the user
hit the ball with the paddle and whether this is or not the new best score.
